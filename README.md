# Hello-World
my first project


this is the first time that Huang.xy join the GitHub,it seems like so cool,isn't it?
Er..sorry,my English is not very good,but i am working on it.
i like English more than Japanese,i thought the interesting is more important than everything.
even through i was failed in something,i will never give up and try to make it better than before.
i belive in myself,i can do better.
it's feel so good that i can express so many what i thought in my heart.it was 4 years ago since the last time i use English.
that's all.
